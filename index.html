<p>Hii Everyone!! This is Day 1 of my new blog...
I am excited to tell you that I will be sharing the things I do daily.</p>










<p>Today was all about relaxation! I woke up at 8:30 and thought what will I do, so I slept again!! At last, I woke up at 9:30 and got ready for my class at 11. Sadly the class is due to some issue delayed to 1...</p>










<p>I finished a movie I was watching with my family and studied most of the time today!! The main reason I am making this blog is that I just learned HTLML and wanted to do something!!</p>










<p>I may not be able to post some days but I will try my best to post every day.</p>










Stay tuned for tomorrow!!




Byeee!!!
